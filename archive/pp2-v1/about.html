        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="About-Part-1">
            <p>Hello there! I'm Jammie, a multi-passionate creative soul with a knack for weaving digital magic. By day, I'm
                a dedicated full stack developer and graphic designer, and by night, I transform into a content creator
                extraordinaire. But perhaps my most cherished role? Being a mom to my wonderful kids.<br /><br />
                When I'm not immersed in the world of code and design, you'll often find me with my nose buried in a book,
                lost in the captivating realms of fiction, or curled up on the couch with my family, indulging in our
                favorite movies. My little ones keep me on my toes, and there's nothing I love more than spending quality
                time playing and exploring the world through their eyes.</p><br />

            <div class="About-Part-2">
                <p>Creativity fuels my every endeavor. Whether it's crafting tangible wonders or crafting digital
                    experiences, I thrive on bringing ideas to life. My passion for web development shines through in every
                    project I undertake. With a blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript wizardry, I craft websites that are not
                    just visually stunning, but also clean, responsive, and effortless to navigate. User experience is at
                    the forefront of my designs, ensuring that every visitor feels right at home from the moment they land
                    on the page.<br /><br />
                    Join me on this journey of creativity and innovation as we explore the endless possibilities of the
                    digital world
                    together.</p>
