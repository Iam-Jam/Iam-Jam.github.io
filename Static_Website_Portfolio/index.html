        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="About-Part-1">
            <p>Hello there! I'm Jammie, a multi-passionate creative soul with a knack for weaving digital magic. By day, I'm a dedicated full stack developer and graphic designer, and by night, I transform into a content creator extraordinaire. But perhaps my most cherished role? Being a mom to my wonderful kids.</p>
            <p>When I'm not immersed in the world of code and design, you'll often find me with my nose buried in a book, lost in the captivating realms of fiction, or curled up on the couch with my family, indulging in our favorite movies. My little ones keep me on my toes, and there's nothing I love more than spending quality time playing and exploring the world through their eyes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="About-Part-2">
            <p>Creativity fuels my every endeavor. Whether it's crafting tangible wonders or crafting digital experiences, I thrive on bringing ideas to life. My passion for web development shines through in every project I undertake. With a blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript wizardry, I craft websites that are not just visually stunning, but also clean, responsive, and effortless to navigate. User experience is at the forefront of my designs, ensuring that every visitor feels right at home from the moment they land on the page.</p>
            <p>Join me on this journey of creativity and innovation as we explore the endless possibilities of the digital world
            together.</p>
